# ðŸ”± ðŸ›’ Triton Marketplace

Using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, we are building a project that unifies UCSD students under an easy to access, safe e-commerce experience for sale and purchase of free and for sale goods (Much like Facebook Marketplace's UCSD Free and For Sale community)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals 

We want to build a platform where UCSD students can safely and reliably sell and purchase used goods online. Being a platform for exclusively the UCSD community allows for more common interests and useful items for specifcally UCSD. No more outdated, ghost posts. No more being worried for safety. No more scams.
